# Basic_Snake_Game
In the Snake Game, we have a digital snake that we control using the arrows keys. A food randomly appears on the screen and our goal is to move the snake so that it eats the food. The snake grows in size after eating a food and our objective is to make the snake as long as possible.
If the snake touches the any side four borders of the screen or if snake come across itself then the game is over, and the game will restart again.
